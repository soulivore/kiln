bugs to fix:
average temps reported were negative,
    patched the problem by putting a negative sign on the 
    determination of T_avg in p_controller.py
kiln failed with the error shown in error.png
    this is probably the same problem as above
    updates:
        the temperature reading seems to still be working without additional modifications
        so what was the problem?
        is the relay coil pulling down the voltage on the 5V line?
