features to add:

somehow plot the target temp curve on start in the terminal. not sure how that works






bugs to fix:

sometimes text does not erase itself when running in screen
problem seems to depend on initial conditions.
got it to work after running vim, exiting, then running kiln





average temps reported were negative,
    patched the problem by putting a negative sign on the 
    determination of T_avg in p_controller.py

kiln failed with the error shown in error.png
    this is probably the same problem as above
    update:
        the temperature reading seems to still be working without additional modifications
        so what was the problem?
        is the relay coil pulling down the voltage on the 5V line? 
    update:
        it was not a code problem--it is an electrical problem
        when I turn on the coils, the temperature in the kiln appears to drop
        this is weird because it seemed to be reading ambient air temp correctly
    fixed:
        the TC was labeled backward. Reveresed polarity on the TC to fix the problem
