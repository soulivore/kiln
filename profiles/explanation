how to read the filenames in this folder:

example: profile_brass_2.5dia_2300_0300

metal: brass
flask diameter in inches: 2.5dia
time to start the program on the previous day: 2300
time at which the program actually starts heating on the next day: 0300

to determine when program ends (i.e. when metal is poured), 
    add total number of program hours to the start time
